        <h1>About Orisha.net</h1>
        <p>Orisha.net is a project idea that comes from the teachings and content from COR-330 Shaking the Spirit. The course focuses on Afro-Creole religions specifically in Cuba. What struck me the most in this course was the variety of Saints or “Orisha’s” that Santeria has. What also spoke to me was the idea of the “patron saint” or “the one that owns your head.” When a person is going through the initiation process in Santeria, they accept the teachings of some of the most powerful and intelligent Oricha’s but eventually receive their “patron” which is their personal Oricha. <br> <br>
When researching these topics, I came across extremely poorly designed website with little content and poor quality photos. To people who are interested in Santeria, but do not have a course or an instructor, these resources are all they have. My project proposal and this prototype is an example of how religious “documentation” can be made in a more fun, inviting, and interactive way. <br> <br>

The idea for this stemmed from those awful personality quizzes on social media that tell you things like who you will end up marrying or what Harry Potter house you belong to. I wanted to create an interactive version of this idea, but include meaningful questions that bring users to actual results. Users can explore their curiosity and see which Oricha they would jive the best with. This could be the beginning of an entire course where you have to go through mock religious practices with your assigned patron. <br> <br>
The site would also offer a more traditional way of receiving your patron. Often times the Oricha one connects the best with does not end up being their patron. A series of divination through cowrie shells is executed, and from these teachings, one finds their Oricha. This application also allows users to throw the cowry shells. The user would have to come to terms with their chosen Oricha just like real new initiates do.
<br> <br>This prototype is just scratching the surface on the potential for interactive religion educational tools, and Santeria seems like a very approachable religion to pilot this movement.
